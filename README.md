Indian Agriculture EDA
======================

Welcome to the Indian Agriculture EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) repository! In this notebook, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the Indian Agriculture dataset, focusing on various crops and their production metrics across different states and years.

Dataset Overview
----------------

We begin by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset. The dataset contains information on different agricultural aspects, such as crop areas, production quantities, and yields, for various states and years in India. The data spans from 1966 to 2017, encompassing 16,146 entries and 80 columns.

Exploring the Dataset
---------------------

To gain insights into the dataset, we start by examining the first and last five rows. This helps us understand the structure of the data, identify key features, and check for any anomalies or missing values.

Following this, we delve into a statistical overview of the dataset, checking for the presence of null values and duplicates. The statistical summary provides key measures such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles for each numeric column.

Data Analysis and Visualization
-------------------------------

We conduct a detailed analysis of specific crops, focusing on production, area, yield, and trends over the years. The crops include Rice, Wheat, Barley, Sunflower, Soyabean, Oilseeds, Cotton, Fruits, Vegetables, Fruits and Vegetables, Potatoes, Onions, Fodder, Kharif Sorghum, Rabi Sorghum, Maize, Finger Millet, Safflower, and Sugarcane.

For each crop, we generate visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, and pie charts to highlight key patterns and insights. The analysis covers top-producing states, production areas, yearly trends, and yield distributions.

Conclusion
----------

This repository serves as a comprehensive exploration of the Indian Agriculture dataset, offering valuable insights into crop production dynamics in different regions and over time. The visualizations provide an intuitive understanding of the data, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in Indian agricultural trends.
